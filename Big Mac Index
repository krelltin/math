The Big Mac index
Question P7.1.1
The Economist's Big Mac Index is a light-hearted measure of purchasing power parity between two currencies. Its premise is that the difference between the price of a McDonald's Big Mac hamburger in one currency (converted into US dollars (USD) at the prevailing exchange rate) and its price in the United States is a measure of the extent to which that currency is over- or under-valued (relative to the dollar).

The following data files provide the historical Big Mac prices and exchange rates for five currencies:

argentina-bigmac.txt
australia-bigmac.txt
china-bigmac.txt
uk-bigmac.txt
us-bigmac.txt

For each of the first four currencies, calculate the percentage over- or under-valuation of each currency as:

(localpriceconvertedtoUSD−USprice)(USprice)×100

and plot it as a function of time.
