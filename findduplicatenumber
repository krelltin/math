#find duplicate number
#Given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive). 
#Prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. 
#Assume that there is only one duplicate number but it could be repeated more than once. 
#Find the duplicate number.

Example 1: 
Input: [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2

#not Pigeonhole Principle!
#not hashmap data structure, std: :map<std: : string, int> mapOfInches = {"name": 4}
